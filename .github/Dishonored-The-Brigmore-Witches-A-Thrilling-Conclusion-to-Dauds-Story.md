## What's Good About The Brigmore Witches?
 
The Brigmore Witches is a well-crafted DLC that delivers on its promise of concluding Daud's story in a satisfying way. It also offers some of the best level design and gameplay variety in the Dishonored series, with plenty of opportunities for creative and emergent solutions. Some of the highlights include:

- The prison break: Breaking into Coldridge Prison is a familiar but fun challenge, with multiple ways to infiltrate, escape and deal with the guards. You can even use your Pull power to grab keys and items from afar, or use your Summon Assassin power to create distractions or reinforcements.
- The gang war: The Draper's Ward mission is a sprawling sandbox that lets you choose how to deal with the two rival gangs, the Dead Eels and the Hatters. You can ally with one or both of them, betray them, or ignore them altogether. You can also find hidden areas and secrets, such as a haunted textile mill, a whale oil refinery and a hidden shrine.
- The witch hunt: The Brigmore Manor mission is a tense and atmospheric finale that pits you against Delilah and her coven of witches. You will have to use all your skills and powers to survive their traps, spells and ambushes. You will also discover more about Delilah's past and motives, and face some moral dilemmas along the way.

## What's Bad About The Brigmore Witches?
 
The Brigmore Witches is not without its flaws, however. Some of the drawbacks include:

- The recycled content: Some of the assets and locations in The Brigmore Witches are reused from the main game or the previous DLC, such as the prison, the sewers and the Overseer music boxes. While this makes sense from a narrative and gameplay perspective, it also feels a bit lazy and uninspired.
- The lack of innovation: The Brigmore Witches does not introduce any new powers or gadgets for Daud, apart from some minor upgrades. It also does not offer any new gameplay mechanics or challenges that differ significantly from the main game or the previous DLC. It feels more like an extension than a standalone experience.
- The final confrontation: The Brigmore Witches ends with a showdown between Daud and Corvo, which should be an epic and emotional climax. However, it is rather anticlimactic and disappointing, as it depends on your chaos level rather than your choices throughout the DLC. It also feels like a missed opportunity to explore the relationship and conflict between the two characters more deeply.

## Final Verdict
 
The Brigmore Witches is a solid DLC that wraps up Daud's story in a satisfying way. It offers some of the best level design and gameplay variety in the Dishonored series, with plenty of opportunities for creative and emergent solutions. It also expands the lore and world of Dishonored with new characters, locations and secrets. However, it also suffers from some recycled content, lack of innovation and a disappointing final confrontation. It is not essential for Dishonored fans, but it is definitely worth playing if you enjoyed The Knife of Dunwall or want to see more of Daud's perspective.
